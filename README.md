# News Website

I'm making this project to brush up my html concepts and this project is used by making html, css and Javascript.
I have used news and weather APIs for this project sn i would recommend that you also use those APIs for updated news and weather forecast.



## Installation

-If you want to open this project, fork this repo and clone this repository in vscode (recommended) or any code editor. 

- If you don't have live server its recommended to install the live server extension or you can run it in your favorite web browser and whatever changes you do in the code will be shown directly.

- Right click and select "Open with live" server and you are good to go.
